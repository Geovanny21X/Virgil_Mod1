      <p>Virgil Abloh was an American fashion designer and entrepreneur. One of the most influential and respected fashion designers of his generation, he began his own line of luxury streetwear clothing, Pyrex Vision, in 2012, and became the chief executive officer of the Milan-based label Off-White, a fashion house he founded in 2013. Abloh was also the artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collection beginning in 2018, and was given increased creative responsibilities across the LVMH brand in early 2021.[1]</p>

      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>After getting his architecture degree Abloh interned at Fendi in the same class as rapper Kanye West in 2009.[7] Placed in the company's Rome, Italy office, the two began a collaborative relationship.[7] During his work with the rapper and designer, Abloh caught the eye of the Louis Vuitton CEO, Michael Burke.[7] Later that year, Abloh and West's artistic partner, Don C, launched a retail store, called the RSVP Gallery,[14] located in Chicago.[7] The store became known for carrying a mixture of fashion apparel, and for its reflection of Abloh's style on his design for the store interior.[7] A year later, West appointed Abloh the creative director of his creative agency, Donda.[7]</p>
